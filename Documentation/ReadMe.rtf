\f1\b0\fs28 \cf0 The Streaming Admin requires Perl 5 (or later) to be running on the server machine. You must install a Perl 5 interpreter in order to use the web-based administration software. \
\
\
To install Darwin Streaming Server 4 software, follow these steps on the server computer:\
\
Stop any Darwin Streaming Server related processes.\
\
When the Server package is unzipped, a folder with Darwin Streaming Server and associated files will be created. Inside this folder is an Install script, named "Install.bat". Double-click this file to install the server and its components on the server machine. The installer also starts up the Streaming Server Admin, so keep the command prompt window open.\
\pard\ql\qnatural

\fs24 \cf0 \'ca\
